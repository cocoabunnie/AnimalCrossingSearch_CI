# üå∫Animal Crossing Critter MERN Search Appüå∫

This was made for an onboarding assignment for an internship I had with Floreo Labs.\
It's a simple website that's meant to be a resource for collectors in Animal Crossing New Horizons. 

You could search for different bugs such as "common butterfly", or "miyama stag", and it will bring up useful information such as the selling price, rarity, and a description from Blathers (a character in the game who is an animal expert) instantly. With each search, you also have the option to save your searches which will then pop up in the "Saved" page. 

On the saved page, the names of the animals you chose to savd will appear in a list, and you will have the option to delete them. 

The site also has an "about" page, which gives you a little information about me and the purpose of the project as well as a list of lessons I've learned and skills I've gained while completing this project. 

This project also has continuous integration implemented using GitHub Actions which is what the "CI" stands for in the repository name. Meaning, when anything is pushed to the main branch, the project is automatically checked for any warnings or errors to prevent any issues from happening when it's deployed/before it's too late. 

Thank you for reading. I hope you like it!üíú

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
